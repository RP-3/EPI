/*
write a function that returns the non-decimal value of dividing one 
integer by another.

Too easy? Do it using only addition, subtraction and bit-wise operators.

The algorithm you learnt for this in primary school is fine for now, but 
for extra credit, find a way to speed it up but an order of magnitude or so
